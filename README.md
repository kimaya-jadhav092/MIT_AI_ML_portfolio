# MIT-AI-ML-Portfolio
Projects from an ML/AI fellowship focused on core machine learning techniques and full end-to-end model development. Includes supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and deployment across real-world datasets.

These projects were developed during a hands-on ML/AI fellowship aimed at deepening technical understanding through real-world application. Beyond building models, I focused on the entire workflow data preprocessing, feature selection, training, evaluation, and interpretability, using tools like Python, scikit-learn, and pandas. The fellowship emphasized practical implementation and critical thinking. Each project highlights a distinct methodology or challenge, whether in classification, clustering, or regression. Through these experiences, I strengthened my ability to develop scalable, reproducible solutions while gaining a deeper understanding of how to apply machine learning in meaningful, results driven ways.
