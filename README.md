# MIT-AI-ML-Portfolio
Projects from an ML/AI fellowship focused on core machine learning techniques and full end-to-end model development. Includes supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, evaluation metrics, and deployment across real-world datasets.

These projects were developed during a hands-on ML/AI fellowship aimed at deepening technical understanding through real-world application. Each project focuses on a different machine learning concept or methodology, including supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I built full end-to-end pipelines—from data preprocessing to model training and validation—using tools like Python, scikit-learn, and pandas.

Beyond technical implementation, the fellowship emphasized clean, reproducible code and thoughtful problem-solving. Projects reflect a range of domains and challenges, allowing me to experiment with various model types, tune hyperparameters, and analyze results with a critical lens. This experience strengthened my ability to apply machine learning techniques to practical problems while maintaining a scalable and interpretable workflow.
